## ligature (fira code)

> [from this](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode#terminal-compatibility-list) both xfce-terminal(Default terminal in manjaro-xfce) and terminator __DO NOT__ support ligatures

- trying to install other terminal (which supports fira code ligatures and split screen (as in terminator) )

- kitty supports split screen and ligature (fira code)
  -  [shortcut for creating split screen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66127831/split-screen-in-kitty)
  - [see this for overview and other info](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/)
  - installed kitty
  - made kitty.conf and other config files related to kitty
